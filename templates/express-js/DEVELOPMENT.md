## Release runbook

Steps to follow after a new version of the [core library](../../lib/core/README.md) has been released.

- [ ] [`package.json`](package.json) has been updated to use the latest version of the `@common-grants/core` library
- [ ] The [`schemas/`](src/api/schemas/) sections have been updated to match the latest CommonGrants schemas
- [ ] All required and optional routes have been added to [`controllers/`](src/api/controllers/)
- [ ] All CI checks are passing (e.g. `npm run checks`, `npm run build`, and `npm audit`)
- [ ] The `express-js` section of [template.json](../template.json) includes paths for all files that should be copied when initializing a new project. **Note:** This should be most, if not all, files in the template (e.g. TypeScript and TypeSpec files, `tspconfig.yaml`, `package.json`, etc.) but not `package-lock.json`. For more information see the [TypeSpec scaffolding docs](https://typespec.io/docs/extending-typespec/writing-scaffolding-template/#adding-new-files).
- [ ] A new project has been initialized from the feature branch version of this template using `tsp init <path-to-raw-template.json> --template express-js`
- [ ] The steps in the [TypeScript user guide](../../website/src/content/docs/guides/using-typescript.mdx) have been successfully completed after initializing a project with the feature branch template
