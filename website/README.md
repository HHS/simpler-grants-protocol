# CommonGrants protocol website

Code for the [CommonGrants protocol website](https://hhs.github.io/simpler-grants-protocol/) and public docs. This site is built using the [Starlight docs](https://starlight.astro.build/) from Astro and hosted on GitHub pages.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The `website/` sub-directory is organized like this:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                 # Stores static assets like favicon
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/             # Stores assets used at build-time like images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/           # Stores the content for the site
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts   # Configures how the content is parsed and loaded
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs        # Configures site details like title, URL, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Manages dependencies and commands
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json           # Manages TypeScript configuration
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.
