**CommonGrants** is an open standard designed to streamline the process of discovering, applying to, and reporting on funding opportunities across the grant ecosystem.

## Core principles

The principles that guide the design of the CommonGrants protocol include:

- **Standardization**: Define a consistent format for sharing grant data
- **Extensibility**: Support customization without breaking integrations
- **Interoperability**: Enable teams to build tools that work across grant platforms
- **Portability**: Allow users to own and move their data between systems

## Vision

The CommonGrants protocol envisions a future in which:

- Grant makers can publish to one platform, and be discovered on any platform
- Grant seekers can find opportunities based on fit, not which portals they've subscribed to
- Grant applicants can focus on delivering impact, instead of translating it between application formats
- Grant platforms can compete for users based on feature quality, rather than on data quantity

## Inspiration

The CommonGrants protocol builds on the design and approach of several existing standards and protocols, including:

- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) - For defining and validating standardized data formats
- [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) - For specifying consistent APIs and interfaces
- [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) - For establishing shared data standards across an industry
- [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) - For enabling decentralized data exchange between platforms
