## About RFCs

RFCs (Requests for Comments) are a collaborative approach to discussing and managing changes to the CommonGrants protocol with the community. Most RFCs will have both a dedicated RFC page that outlines the feedback we're requesting and a corresponding Discourse topic to manage public comments.

### When are RFCs used?

CommonGrants uses RFCs to gather feedback on changes to the protocol or how it's managed. Examples of RFC topics include:

- **Protocol changes:** Adding, updating, or removing fields, models, or routes
- **Management changes:**
  - Modifying the versioning strategy
  - Updating how compliance is defined and measured
  - Changing the governance model

### RFC process

There are two types of RFCs, each with a slightly different process:

#### CommonGrants-driven RFCs
These are introduced by the CommonGrants team to gather feedback on changes in recent releases:

1. The CommonGrants team publishes a new release or pre-release of the protocol
2. The team creates an RFC outlining the changes for which feedback is requested
3. The community reviews the RFC and provides feedback in the corresponding Discourse topic
4. The team reviews feedback and incorporates it into the next release

#### Community-driven RFCs
These are proposed by community members requesting changes in upcoming releases:

1. Community members use the RFC issue template to propose a change
2. The CommonGrants team may meet with the author to clarify and refine the proposal
3. The team translates the proposal into an RFC open for public comment
4. The community reviews the RFC and provides feedback in the corresponding Discourse topic
5. After the comment period ends, the team reviews comments and decides whether to incorporate the proposed change in a future release
