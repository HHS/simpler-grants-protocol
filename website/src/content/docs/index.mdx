## Why CommonGrants?

CommonGrants is part of the [SimplerGrants](https://simpler.grants.gov/) initiative led by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). While SimplerGrants focuses on modernizing the federal grant process, CommonGrants is designed to support a more open and interoperable ecosystem for all types of grants.

#### The problem

The grant ecosystem today is fragmented. A patchwork of portals, formats, and systems creates friction for everyone involved:

- **Funders** must choose between usability and reach.
- **Grant seekers** juggle multiple platforms, answering the same questions over and over.
- **Grant platforms** spend time wrangling inconsistent data from disparate sources.
- **Developers** face steep costs to build tools that only work in one place.

#### The vision

CommonGrants defines a unified API and data model for funding opportunities, applications, and awards — enabling **interoperability by default** and **extensibility by design**.

It lays the groundwork for:

- A **“common app”** experience for grant seekers and funders: faster discovery, simpler applications, less duplication.
- A shared interface for platforms and developers to exchange grant data without building custom integrations for every use case.

By making grant data portable, machine-readable, and easy to connect, CommonGrants helps the ecosystem move from fragmentation to integration.

## Who is it for?

CommonGrants is designed to be adopted by technical teams, while benefiting a wide range of stakeholders:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Funders">
    **Make your grants easier to find, wherever they're posted.**

    Publish once and reach applicants across platforms — no extra lift.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Grant seekers">
    **Spend less time on forms, more time on your mission.**

    Reuse answers. Apply across portals. Focus on the work that matters.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Grant platforms">
    **Focus on features, not brittle integrations.**

    Standardize data exchange with other systems — without reinventing the wheel.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Developers">
    **Build tools once. Connect them anywhere.**

    Work with a consistent interface across platforms — not dozens of custom APIs.
