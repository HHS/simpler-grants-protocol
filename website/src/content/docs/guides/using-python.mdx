Learn how to implement a CommonGrants API in Python using the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) web framework.

## Quickstart

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a new project using the CommonGrants FastAPI template, and then outline steps for extending this template to meet your specific needs.

### Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you'll need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.11+ and Poetry 1.8+
- Node.js 20+ and npm 10+
- CommonGrants and TypeSpec CLIs

Check your versions by running:

```bash
python --version
poetry --version
npm --version
cg --version
tsp --version
```

### First steps

Get a FastAPI project up and running with the following steps:

<Steps>
1. Create a new directory for your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir common-grants-api
    cd common-grants-api
    ```

2. Set up your project using the CommonGrants CLI:

   ```bash
   cg init --template fast-api
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

4. Run the project:

   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

5. Open the API docs:

   ```bash
   open http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

</Steps>

### Project structure

The boilerplate template includes the following files and directories:

<FileTree>

- pyproject.toml # Python project configuration
- poetry.lock # Locked versions of dependencies
- Makefile
- README.md
- src/
  - common_grants/
    - api.py # FastAPI application setup and config
    - routes/ # API route handlers and endpoints
    - schemas/ # Schemas for (de)serialization
    - services/ # Business logic and data operations
- tests/
  - common_grants/
    - schemas/ # Schema-related tests
    - services/ # Service-related tests
    - routes/ # Route-related tests

</FileTree>

## Next steps

Once you've set up your initial project structure, you can start implementing the API routes and services.

### Implementing services

The services layer is responsible for implementing the business logic and data operations for the API. It includes the following files:

<FileTree>

- src/common_grants/services/
  - opportunity.py # Opportunity service
  - utils.py # Utility functions

</FileTree>

In particular, you should focus on updating the `opportunity.py` file. This file contains the implementation of the `OpportunityService` class, which is responsible for fetching and processing opportunities for the following CommonGrants API endpoints:

- `GET /common-grants/opportunities`
- `GET /common-grants/opportunities/{id}`
- `POST /common-grants/opportunities/search`

Some specific changes you should make to this file are:

- Replacing the mock data with a real data source, e.g. a database query or a remote API call.
- Adding the sorting and filtering logic to the the `OpportunityService.search_opportunities` method.

### Adding custom fields

When adopting the CommonGrants protocol, you may need to include information about a funding opportunity that is not explicitly defined by the CommonGrants model for opportunities. The protocol defines a pattern for supporting these kinds of custom fields through the `custom_fields` property on the `OpportunityBase` model.

For example, let's say you need to add a `legacyId` field to map opportunities to an existing ID system. Here's how to do it:

#### Define the custom field

```python opp_custom_fields.py
from common_grants.schemas.fields import CustomField, CustomFieldType
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional

class LegacyId(CustomField):
    """Custom field for a legacy opportunity_id."""

    name: str = "legacyId"
    field_type: CustomFieldType = CustomFieldType.NUMBER
    value: Optional[int] = None
    description: Optional[str] = "Maps to the opportunity_id in the legacy system"


class OppCustomFields(BaseModel):
    """Custom fields for a funding opportunity."""

    legacy_id: Optional[LegacyId] = Field(
        default=None,
        alias="legacyId",
        description="Maps to the opportunity_id in the legacy system",
    )
```

#### Update the `OpportunityBase` model

Update the `OpportunityBase` model to include the new custom field in the `custom_fields` property.

:::note

The sample code below skips other imports and fields for brevity.

:::

```python opp_base.py ins={1, 5-9}
from common_grants.schemas.models.opp_custom_fields import OppCustomFields

class OpportunityBase(SystemMetadata):
    # other fields omitted for brevity
    custom_fields: Optional[OppCustomFields] = Field(
        default=None,
        alias="customFields",
        description="Additional custom fields specific to this opportunity",
    )
```

#### Full example

Here's a full example of defining a custom field within the `opp_base.py` file.

```python opp_base.py
"""Base models for funding opportunities."""

from typing import Optional
from uuid import UUID

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, HttpUrl

from common_grants.schemas.fields import CustomField, CustomFieldType, SystemMetadata
from common_grants.schemas.models.opp_funding import OppFunding
from common_grants.schemas.models.opp_status import OppStatus
from common_grants.schemas.models.opp_timeline import OppTimeline


class LegacyId(CustomField):
    """Custom field for a legacy opportunity_id."""

    name: str = "legacyId"
    field_type: CustomFieldType = CustomFieldType.NUMBER
    value: Optional[int] = None
    description: Optional[str] = "Maps to the opportunity_id in the legacy system"


class OppCustomFields(BaseModel):
    """Custom fields for a funding opportunity."""

    legacy_id: Optional[LegacyId] = Field(
        default=None,
        alias="legacyId",
        description="Maps to the opportunity_id in the legacy system",
    )


class OpportunityBase(SystemMetadata):
    """Base model for a funding opportunity with all core fields."""

    id: UUID = Field(..., description="Globally unique id for the opportunity")
    title: str = Field(..., description="Title or name of the funding opportunity")
    status: OppStatus = Field(..., description="Status of the opportunity")
    description: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Description of the opportunity's purpose and scope",
    )
    funding: OppFunding = Field(..., description="Details about the funding available")
    key_dates: OppTimeline = Field(
        ...,
        description="Key dates for the opportunity, such as when the application opens and closes",
    )
    source: Optional[HttpUrl] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="URL for the original source of the opportunity",
    )
    custom_fields: Optional[OppCustomFields] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="Additional custom fields specific to this opportunity",
    )
```
