Learn how to implement a CommonGrants API in Python using the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) web framework.

## Quickstart

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a new project using the CommonGrants FastAPI template, and then outline steps for extending this template to meet your specific needs.

### Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you'll need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.11+ and Poetry 1.8+
- Node.js 20+ and npm 10+
- CommonGrants and TypeSpec CLIs

Check your versions by running:

```bash
python --version
poetry --version
npm --version
cg --version
tsp --version
```

### First steps

Get a FastAPI project up and running with the following steps:

<Steps>
1. Create a new directory for your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir common-grants-api
    cd common-grants-api
    ```

2. Set up your project using the CommonGrants CLI:

   ```bash
   cg init --template fast-api
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

4. Run the project:

   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

5. Open the API docs:

   ```bash
   open http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

</Steps>

### Project structure

The boilerplate template includes the following files and directories:

<FileTree>

- pyproject.toml # Python project configuration
- poetry.lock # Locked versions of dependencies
- Makefile
- README.md
- src/
  - common_grants/
    - api.py # FastAPI application setup and config
    - routes/ # API route handlers and endpoints
    - schemas/ # Schemas for (de)serialization
    - services/ # Business logic and data operations
- tests/
  - common_grants/
    - schemas/ # Schema-related tests
    - services/ # Service-related tests
    - routes/ # Route-related tests

</FileTree>

## Next steps

Once you've set up your initial project structure, you can start implementing the API routes and services.

### Implementing services

The services layer is responsible for implementing the business logic and data operations for the API. It includes the following files:

<FileTree>

- src/common_grants/services/
  - opportunity.py # Opportunity service
  - utils.py # Utility functions

</FileTree>

In particular, you should focus on updating the `opportunity.py` file. This file contains the implementation of the `OpportunityService` class, which is responsible for fetching and processing opportunities for the following CommonGrants API endpoints:

- `GET /common-grants/opportunities`
- `GET /common-grants/opportunities/{id}`
- `POST /common-grants/opportunities/search`

Some specific changes you should make to this file are:

- Replacing the mock data with a real data source, e.g. a database query or a remote API call.
- Adding the sorting and filtering logic to the the `OpportunityService.search_opportunities` method.

### Adding custom fields

When adopting the CommonGrants protocol, you may need to include information about a funding opportunity that is not explicitly defined by the CommonGrants model for opportunities. The protocol defines a pattern for supporting these kinds of custom fields through the `custom_fields` property on the `OpportunityBase` model.

For example, let's say you need to add a `legacyId` field to map opportunities to an existing ID system. Here's how to do it:

#### Define the custom field

```python opp_custom_fields.py
from common_grants_sdk.schemas.fields import CustomField, CustomFieldType
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional

class LegacyId(CustomField):
    """Custom field for a legacy opportunity_id."""

    name: str = "legacyId"
    type: CustomFieldType = CustomFieldType.NUMBER
    value: Optional[int] = None
    description: Optional[str] = "Maps to the opportunity_id in the legacy system"


class OppCustomFields(BaseModel):
    """Custom fields for a funding opportunity."""

    legacy_id: Optional[LegacyId] = Field(
        default=None,
        alias="legacyId",
        description="Maps to the opportunity_id in the legacy system",
    )
```

#### Extend the SDK's OpportunityBase model

Create a subclass that extends the SDK's `OpportunityBase` model with your custom fields:

```python opp_base.py
from typing import Optional
from uuid import UUID

from pydantic import Field, HttpUrl

from common_grants_sdk.schemas.models.opp_base import OpportunityBase as SDKOpportunityBase
from common_grants_sdk.schemas.models.opp_funding import OppFunding
from common_grants_sdk.schemas.models.opp_status import OppStatus
from common_grants_sdk.schemas.models.opp_timeline import OppTimeline
from .opp_custom_fields import OppCustomFields


class OpportunityBase(SDKOpportunityBase):
    """Extended opportunity model with custom fields."""
    
    # Override the custom_fields property to use our custom fields model
    custom_fields: Optional[OppCustomFields] = Field(
        default=None,
        alias="customFields",
        description="Additional custom fields specific to this opportunity",
    )
```

#### Full example

Here's a complete example of defining custom fields and extending the SDK's `OpportunityBase`:

```python opp_base.py
"""Extended models for funding opportunities."""

from typing import Optional
from uuid import UUID

from pydantic import Field, HttpUrl

from common_grants_sdk.schemas.fields import CustomField, CustomFieldType
from common_grants_sdk.schemas.models.opp_base import OpportunityBase as SDKOpportunityBase
from common_grants_sdk.schemas.models.opp_funding import OppFunding
from common_grants_sdk.schemas.models.opp_status import OppStatus
from common_grants_sdk.schemas.models.opp_timeline import OppTimeline


class LegacyId(CustomField):
    """Custom field for a legacy opportunity_id."""

    name: str = "legacyId"
    type: CustomFieldType = CustomFieldType.NUMBER
    value: Optional[int] = None
    description: Optional[str] = "Maps to the opportunity_id in the legacy system"


class OppCustomFields(BaseModel):
    """Custom fields for a funding opportunity."""

    legacy_id: Optional[LegacyId] = Field(
        default=None,
        alias="legacyId",
        description="Maps to the opportunity_id in the legacy system",
    )


class OpportunityBase(SDKOpportunityBase):
    """Extended opportunity model with custom fields."""
    
    # Override the custom_fields property to use our custom fields model
    custom_fields: Optional[OppCustomFields] = Field(
        default=None,
        alias="customFields",
        description="Additional custom fields specific to this opportunity",
    )
```

This approach allows you to extend the SDK's models with your custom fields while maintaining compatibility with the CommonGrants protocol. Your API can use this extended model for serialization and deserialization, while still being able to convert to and from the standard SDK models when needed.
