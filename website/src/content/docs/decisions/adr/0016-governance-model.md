title: Governance model
description: ADR documenting the governance approach for the CommonGrants protocol
---

The CommonGrants protocol requires a governance model to ensure its evolution is guided by a structured, transparent, and inclusive decision-making process. The governance model should balance early-stage innovation with long-term stability and adoption.

## Decision

The governance model for CommonGrants will follow a two-phase approach:

1. **Short-term: Pre `v1.0` Next 1-2 years**
   - HHS will steward the development of the protocol as part of the SimplerGrants initiative.
   - New features will be proposed through RFCs, with feedback gathered from key stakeholders.
   - Breaking changes may be introduced in minor versions as the protocol matures.
2. **Long-term: Post `v1.0` Next 2-3 years**
   - Establish an independent governance body composed of organizations that have formally adopted the protocol.
   - Define a strategy for engaging all key stakeholders including in the management of the protocol, including:
     - Grantors
     - Grant seekers
     - Open source developers
   - Implement a formal process for reviewing and accepting community-proposed changes.
   - Define a structured release cycle for major and minor protocol updates that prioritize backwards compatibility.

### Consequences

- **Positive consequences**
  - Early development enables rapid innovation and adoption for a concrete use case: Federal grants.
  - Long-term governance ensures stability and consensus-driven evolution.
  - Key stakeholders are actively involved in protocol management throughout the lifecycle.
- **Negative consequences**
  - Initial reliance on HHS may limit broader adoption until governance is decentralized.
  - Transitioning governance structures requires careful execution to maintain momentum.

### Decision drivers

- **Early adoption and innovation:** The governance model should support rapid feature iteration in the early phase.
- **Interoperability and stability:** A long-term governance structure should prioritize stability and broad adoption.
- **Stakeholder inclusion:** The process must ensure input from grant-making organizations, grant seekers, and technology providers.

### Options considered

1. **Stewardship by HHS indefinitely**
   - **Pros:** Centralized decision-making ensures alignment with federal priorities.
   - **Cons:** Limits engagement from non-federal stakeholders, slowing broader adoption.
2. **Immediate formation of an independent governance body**
   - **Pros:** Ensures early stakeholder input and shared ownership.
   - **Cons:** May slow initial development due to consensus-driven decision-making.
3. **Phased transition from HHS stewardship to an independent body (chosen)**
   - **Pros:** Balances early innovation with long-term stability.
   - **Cons:** Requires a clear transition plan to avoid governance gaps.
