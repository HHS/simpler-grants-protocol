title: Protocol compliance
description: ADR documenting the decision to define compliance as implementing all required routes and models.
---

## Summary

### Problem statement

In addition to defining the protocol, we also need to define what it means for a given implementation to ‚Äúcomply‚Äù with that protocol. While ‚Äúcompliance‚Äù could be defined as implementing the base specification exactly, a primary goal of this protocol is to enable platforms to extend the base spec to support data elements and operations that are unique to their implementation. As a result, we need to create a more expansive definition of compliance that accepts some differences between the base spec and a given implementation.

### Decision outcome

We define compliance as implementing all required models and routes from the base spec while allowing implementations to support additional routes and models outside the spec.

- **Positive consequences**
  - Provides a guarantee that all implementation support a minimum set of operations.
  - Allows platforms the flexibility to extend the protocol for unique use cases.
- **Negative consequences**
  - Platforms may implement conflicting or incompatible extensions without additional governance.
  - It may be harder to define the protocol and test for compliance using this definition.
  - Some platforms may be hesitant to start adopting the protocol if they can't implement all required routes.

### Decision drivers

- **Adoption:** Enable incremental adoption by allowing platforms to gradually integrate and replace existing components with the protocol.
- **Interoperability:** Ensure platforms implementing the protocol can interoperate seamlessly using shared core models and routes.
- **Flexibility:** Allow platforms to extend functionality to meet unique requirements without breaking compliance.
- **Consistency:** Prevent partial implementations of the core specification, ensuring a consistent baseline.

### Options considered

## Evaluation

### Side-by-side

| Criteria         | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
| ---------------- | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| Adoption         |    ‚ùå    |    üü°    |    ‚úÖ    |
| Interoperability |    ‚úÖ    |    üü°    |    üü°    |
| Flexibility      |    ‚ùå    |    ‚úÖ    |    ‚úÖ    |
| Consistency      |    ‚úÖ    |    ‚úÖ    |    ‚ùå    |

### Option 1: Strict implementation

Each valid input to the implementation spec is also a valid input to the base spec. The implementation does not define additional routes or types that aren't defined by the base spec.

:::note[Bottom line]
Option 1 is best if:

- we want strict adherence to the base specification.
- but can compromise on flexibility for extensions.
  :::

- **Pros**
  - Simplifies validation since all inputs align with the base spec.
  - Ensures strict adherence to the base specification.
- **Cons**
  - Restricts platforms from extending the protocol to address unique use cases.
  - Limits innovation and scalability.

### Option 2: Full implementation with extensions

The implementation spec includes _all_ of the required routes and types from the base spec, these routes and models provide valid inputs to the base spec. But a given implementation may define additional routes and models outside the base spec.

:::note[Bottom line]
Option 2 is best if:

- we want to balance adherence to the base spec with flexibility for extensions.
- but can accept potential divergence in unsupported extensions.
  :::

- **Pros**
  - Balances adherence to the base spec with flexibility for extensions.
  - Encourages innovation while maintaining compatibility with the base spec.
  - Guarantees that a minimum set of operations are supported by each implementation.
- **Cons**
  - Increases the risk of future conflicts as more operations are added to the base spec.
  - Makes compliance testing slightly more complex

### Option 3: Partial implementation

Implementation doesn't have to implement all required routes and models, but the routes and models it implements do need to provide valid inputs to the base spec.

:::note[Bottom line]
Option 3 is best if:

- we want to maximize flexibility for unique implementations.
- but can accept partial adoption of the spec.
  :::

- **Pros**
  - Offers maximum flexibility for platforms to define their own functionality.
  - Supports a wide range of use cases without restricting innovation.
  - Supports incremental adoption of the protocol.
- **Cons**
  - Increases the risk of non-interoperable implementations.
  - Provides no guarantees to users that an implementation supports certain operations.
  - Makes compliance testing more complex.
