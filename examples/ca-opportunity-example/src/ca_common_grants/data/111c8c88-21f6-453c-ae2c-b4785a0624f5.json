The legislation grants the CAC the authority to identify, designate, and promote areas of concentrated cultural activity.   “California’s cultural districts reflect the extraordinary diversity and creativity that define our state,” said Danielle Brazell, Executive Director of the California Arts Council. “This program is about more than just geography—it’s about creating sustainable ecosystems where artists and cultural workers can thrive, where history and heritage are honored, and where the arts serve as a catalyst for connection and community transformation.”    The Cultural Districts program helps communities harness their unique cultural assets to stimulate local economies, attract tourism, preserve historic sites, and support vibrant, inclusive creative economies. Districts are selected through a rigorous, equity-centered application process that emphasizes authentic community partnerships, vision clarity, and demonstrated cultural depth.   With applications due by August 7, 2025, the Cultural Districts program offers grants up to $10,000 over a two-year period, official state certification, technical assistance, and access to joint marketing and branding resources. The 2025 cohort designation period will run from January 1, 2026 to December 31, 2030, with grant activities taking place from January 1, 2026 to December 31, 2027.   Eligible applicants must be a partnership of at least three organizations—an arts and/or cultural nonprofit or collective, a local business or business association, and a local government entity. Applications and full guidelines are available now at calartscouncil.smartsimple.com.  Only partnerships are eligible to apply, ones that include, at a minimum, a cultural non-profit or artist collective, a local business/business association or a community development corporation, and a branch of local government.  Ensuring that all interested parties have a good understanding of the full array of cultural assets present in the district will be critical to its long-term success.  A comprehensive approach to cultural assets helps to ensure authenticity and the preservation of homegrown assets, a key priority of the California Arts Council.  The application and review process will have three steps, including an open call for applications, site visits for semi-finalists, and finalist selection.  A multi-disciplinary and multi-sector selection panel will review applications and provide ranks for districts to proceed as semi-finalists. Those semi-finalists will receive invitations for site visits by CAC staff. After the site visits, the panel will reconvene to discuss all the ranks and site visit notes and recommend up to 10 districts for designation.","Nonprofit; Other Legal Entity; Public Agency; Tribal Government","Only partnerships including at minimum, a cultural non-profit or artist collective, a local business/business association or a community development corporation, and a branch of local government are eligible to apply.

This program develops projects thatdemonstrate, refine, and outreach innovative, biologically integrated farming systems thatreduce chemical pesticide inputs. For this RFP, we have identified five priority areas (see ProjectPriorities below).  Proposals should advance the goals of California's Sustainable Pest Management (SPM)Roadmap, including efforts to 1) enhance knowledge, research, and technical assistance; 2)align pest control advisors (PCAs) with SPM; and 3) reduce economic risk for growerstransitioning to SPM.  The BIFS application process will occur in two stages: 1) concept proposal submission and 2) fullproposal development. This RFP is to solicit concept proposals. After concept proposal reviewand scoring is complete, OPCA will select up to three applicants to develop full proposals, whichinclude a detailed workplan, budget, budget justification, and letters of support. This RFPoutlines requirements for both concept proposals and full proposals. We anticipate funding oneproposal at the full $1 million. Prior to full proposal development, OPCA scientists will meetwith the selected applicants to discuss reviewer comments as part of a pre-projectconsultation.  The focus of this RFP is to help growers transition away from non-selective, biologicallydisruptive pesticides, especially those of high regulatory concern.

It offers grants to local, state, and federal governmental agencies, and nonprofit organizations for projects to mitigate the environmental impacts caused by new or modified public transportation facilities. There are three types of EEM project: Urban Forestry, Resource Lands, and Mitigation Projects Beyond the Scope of the Lead Agency.","Introduction  EEM projects must contribute to mitigation of the environmental effects of transportation facilities. The California Natural Resources Agency (Agency) prescribes procedures and criteria to evaluate grant project proposals and submits a list of projects recommended for funding to the California Transportation Commission (CTC). The CTC awards grants to projects from Agency’s list.  Related Transportation Facility  EEM projects must mitigate, either directly or indirectly, the environmental impacts of a) the modification of an existing Transportation Facility or b) the construction of a new Transportation Facility (hereafter Related Transportation Facility or RTF). The EEM project can be the required mitigation for the RTF or enhancement to mitigation required for the RTF.  Statewide Project Goals  Agency grant programs assist state and local entities to develop more sustainable communities, increase adaptability to climate change using nature-based strategies, and protect biodiversity in compliance with Executive Order N-82-20, the Pathways to 30 x 30 California, and the Natural and Working Lands Climate Smart Strategy. Projects that demonstrate the following multiple benefits will be more competitive:  • Improved air and/or water quality.  • Reduced consumption of natural resources and energy.  • Increased reliability of local water supplies.  • Increased adaptability to climate change.  • Increased protection and restoration of biodiversity  Eligible Projects Examples  The list below isn't comprehensive, but provides examples of project elements that meet statutory conditions.  Urban Forestry:  • Planting of trees and plants along urban streets and medians.  • Greening existing public lands and structures, including school campuses and urban parks.  • Greening vacant lots and abandoned sites.  • Restoration of urban creeks.  Resource Lands:  • Removal of invasive and restoration of natural plant species.  • Enhancement or restoration of natural areas such as inland wetlands, forests, oak woodlands, mountain meadows, creeks, and streams with riparian or riverine fish or wildlife habitat, wildlife corridors and fish passages, coastal estuaries, grazing land and grasslands.  • Acquisitions in fee title or through conservation easements to safeguard regional water supplies, protect riparian and wildlife habitats, conserve agricultural lands for secure wildlife migration corridors, and provide public access for compatible wildlife/nature-oriented recreation by the wider community.  • Acquisitions to preserve in perpetuity Resource Lands for agricultural uses, open space, wetlands, biodiversity, etc.  Mitigation Projects Beyond the Scope of the Lead Agency:  Project examples listed under Urban Forestry and Resource Lands categories may be eligible for the Mitigation Projects Beyond the Scope of the Lead Agency category, if the mitigation or enhancement measures for the RTF were infeasible or beyond the jurisdiction and/or authority of the Lead Agency for the RTF.

OCPSC is also expected to strengthen the ability of local organizations to serve vulnerable communities across California.  Using the best practices identified through prior work, OCPSC has partnered with community- based organizations throughout the state that can build trust with communities through on-the- ground engagement. OCPSC has also partnered with intermediary, nonprofit organizations that have the capacity and local networks to strengthen civic engagement across sectors. These partnerships have been made up of community-based organizations (CBOs) and other nonprofit organizations who reflect the language and culture of the community they serve and can have authentic interactions with their communities and provide accurate information and resources on critical issues.  The Capacity Building and Community Engagement (CBCE) Grant Program is designed to build strengthening capacity for CBOs. It will result in a network of funded partners who can support local, community-based organizations to thrive in an environment characterized by change and uncertainty. The Awardee for this RFA will be responsible for building a network of CBOs and a program that can enhance their capacity building training to enable organizations to be better equipped for engagement with the state and future challenges their communities may encounter.  As part of this grant program, the awardee will 1) develop a local and/or collaborative network of community-based organizations and other entities, and 2) strengthen the capacity of CBOs and provide them with technical assistance on effective response to state programs. Activities of the program may include the ability to form collaborative networks, leverage resources, and strengthen organizational capacity. These CBOs will also tie their work back to OCPSC’s ongoing priorities including:  1.     Hard-to-reach, vulnerable communities and people otherwise missed by larger community- based efforts will be served by “trusted messengers”. OCPSC learned during Census 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic that, when funded, small CBOs can effectively conduct awareness and outreach.  2.     The activities and shared learning opportunities with this grant’s support will strengthen local capacity and relational connection between all partners, providing pathways for relief to impacted communities.  3.     OCPSC will learn and engage with communities regarding their unique community resilience for current and future priority issue areas.   ","Nonprofit","The Applicant, or its Fiscal Sponsor, must have an active and approved tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status issued by the Internal Revenue Code, have an active tax-exempt status with the State of California Franchise Tax Board as of the application submittal deadline, and must submit an IRS Form 990.
